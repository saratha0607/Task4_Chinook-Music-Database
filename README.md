The goal is to analyze customer behavior, sales performance, and revenue distribution using relational data.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **categories** – product categories  

Primary and foreign keys were used to establish relationships between tables.

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- Loaded dataset into SQL database
- Applied **INNER JOIN** to combine customers and orders
- Used **LEFT JOIN** to identify customers with no orders
- Calculated **total revenue per product**
- Generated **category-wise revenue distribution**
- Applied filters using `WHERE` clause for business queries
